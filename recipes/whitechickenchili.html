  <p><em>Flavorful </em><strong>White Chicken Chili </strong>made with hearty beans, tender chicken, and a rich and creamy broth. It’s a lighter alternative to traditional beef chili and makes for a super satisfying dinner! If you’re lucky to have any left it will make great leftovers for lunch the next day too. </p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Chicken</strong> - I prefer rotisserie chicken but left-over cooked chicken will work great too.</li>
        <li><strong>Garlic and Onion</strong> - these aromatics adds lots of flavor here. Use fresh minced garlic.</li>
        <li><strong>Chicken Broth</strong> - for even more flavor try this soup with a homemade broth.</li>
        <li><strong>Green Chilies</strong> - be sure to buy the mild kind unless you like heat.</li>
        <li><strong>Cannellini Beans</strong> - great northern beans also work well.</li>
        <li><strong>Lime</strong> - be sure to use fresh lime juice, not bottled.</li>
        <li><strong>Cilantro</strong> - if you have the gene that makes it taste like soap, grow up.</li>
        <li><strong>Avocado</strong> - truuuuuust.</li>
    </ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a 6 quart enameled Dutch oven over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Add onion and saute 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add garlic and saute 30 seconds longer.</li>
        <li>Add chicken broth, green chilies, cumin, paprika, oregano, coriander, cayenne pepper and season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Bring mixture just to a boil then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Drain and rinse beans in a fine mesh strainer or colander then measure out 1 cup.</li>
        <li>Set whole beans aside, transfer 1 cup beans to a food processor along with 1/4 cup broth from soup, puree until nearly smooth.</li>
        <li>Add Neufchatel cheese to soup along with corn, whole beans and pureed beans and stir well. Simmer 5 – 10 minutes longer.</li>
        <li>Stir in chicken, fresh lime juice and cilantro. Serve with Monterrey Jack cheese, more cilantro, avocado slices and tortilla chips if desired.</li>
    </ol>
