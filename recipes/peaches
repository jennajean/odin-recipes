  <p>Nothing says summertime like sweet peaches cooked with brown sugar and butter, then topped with vanilla ice cream. This is the simplest summer dessert, but it’s always a favorite! </p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Peaches</strong> - If peaches are not in season, you can use frozen peaches, but I do recommend using fresh fruit as I think it has the best flavor and texture in this recipe.</li>
        <li><strong>Brown Sugar</strong> - I like brown sugar in this recipe, but you could use granulated sugar in a pinch.</li>
        <li><strong>Vegan Buttery Spread</strong> - I used Earth Balance Soy Free Vegan Buttery Spread, but if you have a different brand of vegan butter that works for you, feel free to use that instead. If you can eat dairy, feel free to use regular butter.</li>
        <li><strong>Ice Cream</strong> - You can use any ice cream or topping that works for your dietary needs. Try coconut milk ice cream, soy milk ice cream, So Delicious Coco Whip Topping, or any ice cream that suits you!</li>
